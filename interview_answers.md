# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.
​
1. Explain what a token is used for.

A token is a string of cryptic text, which can be stored on the client-side using local storage or session storage. The server can readily tell the client that it issued the token. It can also read token and make decisions for data transfer based on the client's permission.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

Use Routes and authentication tokens are good for keeping data secure.I can take a  <Redirect /> component from react-router that will redirect the user to a given route.
​
3. Describe how web servers work.

The term "web server" can mean: 
1) a computer that stores the code for a website or 
2) a program that runs on such a computer.
The web server is connected to the internet, and stores the code for different websites to be shared across the world at all times. 
When we load the code for our websites, or web apps, on a server like this, we would say that the server is "hosting" our website/app.
However, the server itself needs some code to tell it what to do, right? That software program is called… a web server! 
Its main purpose is to "serve" web pages it retrieves from your project code to users upon request.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

GET- read data
POST- insert data
PUT or PATCH- update data or insert if new ID
DELETE- delte data 
The most common CRUD acronym to view, search, and changing information is update/PUT to create and update with a map.
